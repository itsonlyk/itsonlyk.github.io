<h1>About me!</h1>

<p>Graduation 2028
  School Pocomoke High School
  My aspire towards Comp Sci Knowledge is to become very smart and create apps for people work or even make my own company directing to Comp Sci.
  And I love learning new things!
This Web page will be about my expierence and everything I have done in computer science classes.
At the moment I am taking 2 classes such as CSE and Foundations of computer science.</p>

<p>In these classes I have made multiple apps and coding languages.
For example the first langauage we started with was Block Coding. These are the apps and projects we have created.</p>
<p>  Classes I will be taking are CSE, CSP, CSA, Cyber Security. (I will link my pages for those classes in the future when completed.)
Some things I have done already in CSE are multiple projects, for example I created a game that can cure boredom.
  Here are the images to the game.  This game works in many ways, it has a timer and it slowly increases in speed as you play the game. The png will move around the screen depending on where you have the device tilted.
  The longer you play the game with out failing the higher your score gets.

<p>We have also done another project called 2.1.4 which is a Self Driving Vehicle Project.
  The Goal of this project is use two-dimensional lists in a program.
Collaboratively modify and develop a program  that uses two-dimensional lists.
Understand the full knowledge of the program and the code.</p>

  <p>Code - 

  Flow Chart Logic -</p>

  <p>Reflection - What is the benefit of developing a project in smaller developmental iterations?</p> 
  <p>Helps us to get early feed back and being able to address issues more quickly than usual.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of declaring variables globally?  We are able to access the global variables anywhere through out the program also making it easier to share data.</p>
<p>What strategies could you apply to increase the chances your self-driving vehicle could navigate an environment without hitting anything? We can add sensors to where it doesnt hit anything that comes across the front of the vehicle depending on the direction it's going.</p>
