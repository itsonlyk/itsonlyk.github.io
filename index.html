<h1>About me!</h1>

<p>Graduation 2028
  School Pocomoke High School
  My aspire towards Comp Sci Knowledge is to become very smart and create apps for people work or even make my own company directing to Comp Sci.
  And I love learning new things!
This Web page will be about my expierence and everything I have done in computer science classes.
At the moment I am taking 2 classes such as CSE and Foundations of computer science.</p>

<p>In these classes I have made multiple apps and coding languages.
For example the first langauage we started with was Block Coding. These are the apps and projects we have created.</p>
<p>  Classes I will be taking are CSE, CSP, CSA, Cyber Security. (I will link my pages for those classes in the future when completed.)
Some things I have done already in CSE are multiple projects, for example I created a game that can cure boredom.
  Here are the images to the game.
